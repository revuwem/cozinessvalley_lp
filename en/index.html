                                <li>Is the lake boundary expanding or shrinking based on the supply of water from two sources, as indicated in provided plan?</li>
                                <p>The lake is formed from melt water from several streams and its boundaries are shown roughly. Lake is increasing in spring and summer and reduces in winter.</p>
                                <li>Is it possible to transfer the distance-heating pipes and power lines located at the competition area?</li>
                                <p>We would recommend not to include large-scale works like that in your project. Setback area for power lines is 20 m. At the setback area are prohibited: construction, mining, explosive blasting, tree planting, placement
                                    of patrol stations, placement of sports facilities, etc.</p>
                                <li>Can water be used for any purpose?</li>
                                <p>Yes, taking into account all the seasonal deformations and water purification, you can include in your project alternative use of water as redirecting streams, etc.</p>
                                <li>There are shallow swamps around the lake. Is swamp vegetation of any importance to the ecosystem and is city interested in its preservation?</li>
                                <p>At the moment, these zones are not of any importance for completion area’s ecosystem and they are not protected, so using or preserving these zones is left to the discretion of the participant.</p>
                                <li>Should we consider that the surfaces surrounding the lake should be protected, and if so, what are limitations?</li>
                                <p>The territory has no conservation status.</p>
                                <li>. Is capital construction allowed on the competition territory?</li>
                                <p>Yes, construction is permitted at the competition area. But do not forget that the main purpose of the competition is development of park area and all the buildings that you are planning to include in your proposal should
                                    not shift the focus from the main function of the territory. </p>

                                <li>What is exact budget of the project?</li>
                                <p>We do not set limits for the budget, everything will depend on the winning proposal. Funding sources will be specified after the winner is announced. Winning proposal will form the basis for the investment project. Of course,
                                    the project should be somehow pragmatic and the economic effect should be commensurate with the funds set for the implementation. Estimated cost of the project is optional and can be attached to the proposal at the
                                    discretion of the participant.</p>
                                <li>As for the prize money for the first place (in the “Professionals” category), does it include budget for developing of the Design Stage by the winning office/individual? </li>
                                <p>The Winner Prize is the award for the winning proposal only. Design Stage documentation and works on the project implementation are not included in indicated amount.</p>
                                <li>Is your organization going to be the ones to develop winning proposal? Will the winning office be involved in the project implementation?</li>
                                <p>The author of the winning project will be involved in the development of Design Stage documentation and architectural supervision in any case. The format of cooperation will depend on the legal status of the winner. If
                                    it is an architectural bureau, there will be direct negotiations on the conclusion of the contract and development of project documentation. If the winner is an initiative group or individual designer, our organization
                                    will include them in the project team for the documentation development.</p>
